🛒 Super Store Sales Data Analysis & Visualization Project

This project demonstrates the full workflow of transforming raw retail sales data into clear and actionable visual insights.

The original Super Store dataset contained raw transactional data that required preparation before analysis. I started with data cleaning, where I removed unnecessary columns, fixed data types, handled inconsistencies, and ensured the data was accurate and ready for analysis.

Next, I applied data transformation to create meaningful metrics such as:

Total and average sales

Profit analysis

Sales performance by category, sub-category, and region

Customer and product-level comparisons

These transformations made it possible to identify trends, performance differences, and business insights hidden in the raw data.

Finally, the cleaned and transformed dataset was visualized using Power BI, where I built interactive dashboards to analyze:

Sales and profit performance

Regional and category-based trends

High-performing and low-performing products
